                <h3>Real-time Analytics for Teachers and Students</h3>
                <p>The platform provides insights into students' academic progress and mental well-being. Teachers can see which students are excelling, struggling, or might need extra support based on both their learning progress and mental health indicators. For students, personalized dashboards show their learning achievements alongside their well-being metrics, encouraging them to maintain a healthy balance between work and rest.</p>

                <h3>Alert System</h3>
                <p>If a student shows signs of burnout or consistently poor mental health indicators, the system can automatically alert teachers or counselors to intervene early, offering support before the student becomes overwhelmed.</p>
